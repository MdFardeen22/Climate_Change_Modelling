# Climate Change Modelling 🌍

This repository contains a comprehensive project on **Climate Change Modelling**, aimed at understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change using advanced data science and machine learning techniques.

## 📋 Project Overview

Climate change poses one of the greatest challenges to humanity. Through this project, we explore:
- Historical climate data analysis.
- Prediction of future climate trends.
- Impact assessment of climate policies.
- Scenario modeling to aid decision-making.

The project integrates datasets, visualizations, and predictive models to provide insights into global climate patterns.

## 🔧 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks for climate predictions.
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive plots for temperature, precipitation, and carbon emissions trends.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Simulations for various climate policy scenarios.
